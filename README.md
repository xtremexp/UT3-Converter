converting/porting UT maps. This tool automates some task
for conversion which means conversion of level ressources

---

# UTx conversions supported
------------------------------
UT3 Converter 2 supports these conversions:
* Unreal Tournament -> Unreal Tournament 2004
* Unreal Tournament -> Unreal Tournament 3
* Unreal Tournament 2004-> Unreal Tournament 3

---

# Requirements
You need:
* Two of the following UT games:
    * Unreal Tournament
    * Unreal Tournament 2004
    * Unreal Tournament 3
* Java technology installed (see www.java.com)
* Some skills with UnrealEd software

---

# Installation and first start
* Decompress the ZIP archive to any folder of your choice.
* Double-click on UT3Converter2.jar.
* If not working install java (https://www.java.com/) or create some "run.bat" file with notepad that you will save in the root program folder with this in it
> java -jar ut3converter2.jar 
* this will force launching this file associating it as java program

---

# What this program converts
* Textures
* Brushes
* Staticmeshes
* Weapons
* Pickups
* Most of main actors

--- 

# What this program DOES NOT converts
* Custom scripts
* Special textures (shaders,pantex,...)
---

# Limitation/Issues/Known bugs
* All - Do not work with folders with spaces (e.g.: "C:\Program Files\UnrealTournament")
* UT and DeusEx Games - Will not convert custom textures in external packages (not in myLevel/e.g: ../Textures/myPackage.utx) for 
* UT2004->UT3 - Some staticmeshes can't be converted. ("ucc batchexport mypackage.usx StaticMesh t3d" cmd bug)
* Can't convert maps using UTF16-LE or UTF16-BE t3d file encoding. Check that mapname doesn't have exotic chars such as {%^,.. but only alphanumeric values (a->z,0->9) then save your map.

# Origin of the project
As a mapper with mainly UT2004 level editor (UnrealEd) and as
UT3 was released i wanted to port some of my maps to UT3 but
didn't suceed, that's why i started digging into Unreal Technology
concept
